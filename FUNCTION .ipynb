What is the difference between a function and a method in Python?\n","\n","  -> In Python, the main difference between a function and a method is that a function is independent and can be called from anywhere, while a method is tied to an object or class.\n","\n","Function ex: def greet(name):\n","  print(f\"Hello,{name}!\")\n","\n","\n","Methods ex:  append(), count(), Pop(),extend()."],"metadata":{"id":"11kX8BdDWaIT"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["2. Explain the concept of function arguments and parameters in Python\n","\n","  -> Parameters :\n","These are the variables listed inside the parentheses in the function definition. They define the type and number of inputs a function can accept. Parameters are part of the function's signature and are local to the function where they are defined.\n","\n","ex: len(\"a,b,c\")\n","the \"a,b,c\" is a parameter value.\n","\n","Arguments :\n","These are the values that are passed to the function when it is called. Arguments provide the flexibility to pass different values to a function, allowing for dynamic execution. Arguments can be any scope, including variables that exist outside the function or literals.\n","\n","ex:- def say_hello(\"my_name\"):\n","  print(\"hello\", my_name)"],"metadata":{"id":"64O8EbWrWZdn"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["3. What are the different ways to define and call a function in Python\n","\n","  -> To define a function in Python, you can use the def keyword, followed by the function name, parameters, and the function body.\n","\n","  ex:- def my_function():\n","      print(\"Hello from a function\")\n","\n","\n","   To call a function, you can use the function name followed by parentheses.\n","\n","  ex:- my_function().\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"eWzi5xrtWYo0"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["4. What is the purpose of the `return` statement in a Python function?\n","\n","  -> The purpose of the return statement in Python is to exit a function and send a value back to the caller.\n","\n","  ex:- return total_marks(marks_list)"],"metadata":{"id":"L-eM7m4FWRD1"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["5. What are iterators in Python and how do they differ from iterables?\n","\n","  -> An Iterable is basically an object that any user can iterate over. We can generate an iterator when we pass the object to the iter() method.\n","\n","  iterable ex:- list[1, 2, 3,4]\n","  \n","  iterator ex:- a = iter(s)"],"metadata":{"id":"E9_uQ_G7czvm"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["6. Explain the concept of generators in Python and how they are defined\n","\n","  -> A generator in Python is a function that generates a sequence of values by using the yield keyword instead of the return keyword.\n","\n","  A generator function returns an iterator object that can be looped through using a for loop. The generator produces values one at a time, and retains its state between successive yields. This allows it to resume where it left off.\n","\n","  ex:- my_gen = (x**2 for x in range(10) if x%2 == 0)."],"metadata":{"id":"_C16ptDLczjx"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["7. What are the advantages of using generators over regular functions?\n","\n","  -> Generators in Python have several advantages over regular functions, including:\n","Memory efficiency: Generators are memory-efficient because they only compute values when needed.\n","Readability: Generators can lead to more readable and concise code.\n","Speed: Generators can improve performance and responsiveness in applications.\n","Infinite streams of data: Generators can represent infinite streams of data.\n","On-demand values: Generators can return multiple values, one after another, on-demand.\n","Lazy evaluation: Generators compute values only when needed.\n","\n","ex:- def fib(num)."],"metadata":{"id":"iwRf4TcgczXw"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["8. What is a lambda function in Python and when is it typically used?\n","\n","  -> In Python, a lambda function is a small, anonymous function that is created on the fly.\n","  \n","   It is used when a function is needed for a short period of time or when creating a full-fledged function using def would be overkill.\n","\n","   ex:- len = lambda x: length(x)."],"metadata":{"id":"KlbaPGQ9czMu"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["9. Explain the purpose and usage of the `map()` function in Python\n","\n","  -> The Python map() function applies a function to each item in an iterable, such as a list, tuple, or dictionary, to create a new iterable. The map() function is a built-in function that can help reduce code size and make it run faster by avoiding the use of loops.\n","\n","  ex:- list(map(lambda x: x**2))."],"metadata":{"id":"S3_nUaBQcy5e"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["10. What is the difference between `map()`, `reduce()`, and `filter()` functions in Python?\n","\n","  -> Map applies a given function to each item of an array and returns a new array. Filter creates a new array with all elements that pass a test implemented by the provided function. Reduce applies a function against an accumulator and each element in the array (from left to right) to reduce it to a single output value.\n","\n","  examples:- Map => list(map(lambda x:x**2))\n","\n","  Reduce => reduce(lambda x, y: x+y,1)\n","\n","  Filter => list(filter(check_even,num))."],"metadata":{"id":"Xt7buPUPcykX"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["11.
